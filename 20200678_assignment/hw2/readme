I spent 23 hours to do this assignment2.

"I only used the pointer notation for this assignment2."

- To search for answers to the question asked to write in the readme file (right below)

"Is it possible for StrCopy to call assert to verify that the destination memory area specified by the caller is large enough? Explain."

Ans) No. To assert to verify that memory area of Dest is large enough, we need to know the exact memory size of Dest. 
But we cannot get the size of destination buffer. In C, we cannot measure memory size only with pointer. 
(Therefore, it is not related to the implementation, but related to 'how user may use this function'.

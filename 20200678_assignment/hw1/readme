- To check how to print the standard error stream.

I spent about 10 hours on this assignment 1.

( At first, I tried to count the number of newlines, words, and characters after performing
'decommenting' first as shown in the guideline. However, I spent more time thinking about
how to do all of these stuff at once. As a result, like the code I submitted, I use some proper
states and appropriate variables for each transition to achieve the goal. )

- Command CBW, CWD, CDQ

INFO
- check the first non-digit character of input as like switch statement
  (namely, p, q, +, -, *, /, %, ^, _, f, c, d, r)

- For underscore character, ignore _ and change into int.
And then, multiply -1 is done. Here, error can occur for INT_MIN case.
So, exceptionally handle the INT_MIN case. (line 325)

- To use imull, 32bit division requires %eax be sign-extended into %edx.
So, use cdq. quotient (for /) is in %eax, remainder (for %) is in %edx.

- Overflow can occur for +, -, *, ^ cases
- Also can occur for / cases. Only when INT_MIN/(-1).
In that case, I exceptionally handle it. overflow error for /, and 0 for %. (line 239, 269)
- Zero-division can occur for /, % cases

- implement exponent function ('^') by calling "mypowerfunc". (line 305)
